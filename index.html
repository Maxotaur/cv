        <p>I am an officer of the now defunct guild on Thunderfury called <a href="http://www.lootgoblins.net">LG</a>.</p>
        <p>The image you see to the left is an unemployed person ganking my warrior on his way to Naxxramas. In an epic display of pvp prowess, this individual used his rogue abilties to kill me as I watched 39 other people ignore my death and run directly into the raid instance. By doing so they kept their world buffs, and got awesome and amazing large cocked parses. Additionally, we extracted gold out of players that broke terms of services by conducting RMT on <a href="https://www.g2g.com">g2g.com</a/>.</p>
